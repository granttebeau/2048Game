# 2048Game

An implementation of the popular game '2048' using the Java programming language and various different libraries. 

## Motivation

After finishing the CS 2510 class at Northeastern University and being stuck in quarantine, I wanted to challenge myself to build something
that was slightly harder than what we did in class, and implementing 2048 was a good fit. 

## Tests

Tests are written using JUnit. To run, go to an IDE and run the tests like normal. A helpful guide can be found 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-run-debug-configuration-for-tests.html).

## Tech/Libraries Used

* Java's AWT package - for animations and KeyEvents
* JUnit - for testing

## Acknowledgments

* The Northeastern CS 2510 professors/TAs for helping me develop the tools to accomplish this
